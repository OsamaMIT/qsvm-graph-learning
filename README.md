# QSVM for Graph Learning that Preserves Topological Structure
Part of research on implementing quantum support vector machines on multi-dimensional graph based data to preserve its topogical strucutre for more meainingful classification.
Mainly trained on TUDataset's PROTEINS dataset for the classification of enzyme proteins.

10-Fold Cross-Validation Accuracy: 0.7448 Â± 0.0375 (74.48%)
1. Preserves topological structure of graph data
2. Consistent sub 3:00 training time
3. Relatively simple feature map
4. Highly interpretable model

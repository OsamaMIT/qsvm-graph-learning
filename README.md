# QSVM for Graph Learning that Preserves Topological Structure
Part of research on implementing quantum support vector machines on multi-dimensional graph based data to preserve its topogical strucutre for more meainingful classification.
Mainly trained on TUDataset's PROTEINS and MUTAG datasets for the classification of biological molecules.

10-Fold Cross-Validation Accuraces: 
PROTEINS - 74.48% ± 3.75
MUTAG - 83.48% ± 6.61

1. Preserves topological structure of graph data
2. Consistent sub 3:00 training time
3. Relatively simple feature map
4. Highly interpretable model
